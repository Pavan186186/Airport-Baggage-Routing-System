# Airport-Baggage-Routing-System
In this project we have utilized quickest path algorithm for our baggage routing system. This
algorithm is utilized by keeping baggage handling systemâ€™s elements like Check-in, baggage handling
and baggage collection into consideration. Our system not only uses time as a parameter for
optimization but capacity of paths is also considered, which makes it more practical and viable to
apply. With this baggage routing system, we also tried to solve the problem of not knowing the
position of the bag by giving a visual information about the position of the baggage which makes it
easy for the passenger to track it also know the time in which he can receive the bag from the counter.
We also tried to represent the working of our baggage routing system visually by using different
python libraries to simulate the algorithm in action.
